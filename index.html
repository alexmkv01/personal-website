          <p>I used to have a respectable chop around the 5 second mark, but the years have gotten to me, I am no longer the
          man I once was.

          <p> My silly bitch of an ex-flatmate, somehow managed to 'innocently' publish a very bad hate crime on a social media account
              affiliated with a left-wing university. I have taken it
              upon my honourable self to always riddicule him about the said incident

          <h3>Recycling Chat</h3>
          <p>Recycling chat has always been a peversely erotic fascination of mine. Whilst I am a long way from Fridge level
          of chat-recyclement, with notable examples being "rent free" which he has been pestering on for 2 years
          because somebody once said it to Ellis Genge, and "Rees Zammit is a fraud" which he stole from his rugby captain
          (making him extremely popular with the committee as you would imagine)

          <h3>Throttling Shorrock</h3>
          <p> After being abused for my above average sized mummy milkers ðŸ¥› for hours on end by a gubby little choad
          called Shorrock, I decided to act maturely and responsibly by showing off my throttling skills. An entertaining
          night in summary - I have since used Shorrock's tears as lube to wank with.
